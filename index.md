Hi there!

I am a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google). My goal is to build intelligent agents and robots that can act in virtual and physical environments.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher and a PhD student with [Ingmar Posner](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/ingmar-posner/) at the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk). My PhD was funded by an EPSRC DTA studentship and a Google studentship. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in engineering with a specialisation in electronic and information engineering at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk).

I have co-authored papers on agents that follow language instructions in video games, object-centric representation learning and image generation, sparse convolutions for object detection and segmentation in 3D point clouds, learning functions on sets, quadruped locomotion, and path planning for robot arms.
