title: About
---

I am a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google).
My goal is to build intelligent agents and robots that can act in virtual and physical environments.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher and a PhD student with [Ingmar Posner](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/ingmar-posner/) at the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk).
My PhD was funded by an EPSRC DTA studentship and a Google studentship.
Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in engineering with a specialisation in electronic and information engineering at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk).

## Service

I have served as a conference reviewer for CVPR, ICRA, IROS, and RSS and as a journal reviewer for IJCV and RA-L.
